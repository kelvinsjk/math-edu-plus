# math-edu-plus

A mathematics library to make working with mathematics digitally easier.

In addition to the many classes, methods, and functions implemented, a main focus of the library is
to blur the lines between working with mathematics on a computer and showing it (with almost all classes having a
`toString()` method that outputs $LaTeX$.)

For a showcase of what is possible, [Math Bounty](https://math-bounty.vercel.app) is a series of questions/answers
generated using the library.

Also see the ["vanilla" `math-edu` library](https://github.com/kelvinsjk/math-edu) that has 0 dependencies and contains only the essentials.

Documentation and tutorials is under construction and coming very soon.
