## Type aaa: 2007 P1 Q6

### Question

Given two points $A$ and $B$.

- (a) Show that $OA$ and $OB$ are perpendicular.
- (b) Find the position vector of the point $V$ on the line segment $AB$ such that $AV: VB = \lambda: \mu$.
- (c) Given $C$, find the exact area of triangle $OAC$.

### Notes

Implemented as `type aaa`

`qnCode` for actual question: `aaa1A2241D2212`.

## Question variations

There are three broad variations in this question, indicated by each of the first three letters in the `qnCode`.

1. `a`: $V$ is on $AB$ vs `b`: $V$ is on $AB$ extended.
2. `a`: The 'natural' ratio is given (e.g. $AV:VB$) vs `b` the ratio to the whole is given (e.g. $AV: AB$).
3. `a`: Area of triangle $OAC$ vs `b`: area of triangle $OBC$.
