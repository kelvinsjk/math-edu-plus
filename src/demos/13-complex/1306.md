## Type 1: 2007 P1 Q7

### Question

The polynomial $P(z)$ has real coefficients. The equation $P(z) = 0$ has a root $r \mathrm{e}^{i \theta}$, where $r > 0$ and $- \pi < \theta \leq \pi$.

- (a) Write down a second root in terms of $r$ and $\theta$, and show that a quadratic factor of $P(z)$ is $z^2 - 2 (r \cos \theta) z + r^2$.
- (b) Let $w = R \mathrm{e}^{i \alpha}$. Show that $w^n = -k$, where $k$ is a positive real number to be determined.
- (c\) It is given that $w_1, w_2$ are roots of $z^n = -k$. Use this and parts (a) and (b) to write $z^n + k$ as a product of two/three quadratic factors with real coefficients.

$R$ is 2 or 3, $\alpha$ is $\frac{m\pi}{n}$, $n$ is 4 or 6.

## Type 2

### Question

The polynomial $P(z)$ has real coefficients. The equation $P(z) = 0$ has a root $x+yi$, where $x,y \in \mathbb{R}, y \neq 0$.

- (a) Write down a second root in terms of $x$ and $y$, and show that a quadratic factor of $P(z)$ is $z^2 - 2 x z + x^2 + y^2$.
- (b) Let $P(z) = z^4 + bz^3 + cz^2 + dz + e$, where $b, c$ and $d$ are real. It is given that $w_1, w_2$ are roots of $P(z) = 0$. Use (a) to express $P(z)$ as a product of two quadratic factors with real coefficients, and hence determine the value of $b, c$ and $d$.
