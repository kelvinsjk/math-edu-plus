# Implemented Questions

## Type 1: 2007 P1 Q5

### Question

- (a) Write $\displaystyle y=\frac{ax+b}{x+c}$ in the form $\displaystyle y=A + \frac{B}{x+c}$ and describe a sequence of transformations which transform the graph of $y=\displaystyle \frac{1}{x}$ to the graph of $\displaystyle y=\frac{ax+b}{x+c}$.
- (b) Sketch the graph of $\displaystyle y=\frac{ax+b}{x+c}$, giving the equations of any asymptotes and the coordinates of any axial intercepts.
