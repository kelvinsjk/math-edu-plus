## Type 1: 2007 P1 Q8

### Question

The line $l$ passes to through the points $A (a_x, a_y, a_z)$ and $B (b_x, b_y, b_z)$. The plane $p$ has equation ${n_x x + n_y y + n_z z = d}$. Find

- (a) the coordinates of the point of intersection of $l$ and $p$.
- (b) the acute angle between $l$ and $p$.
- (c\) the perpendicular distance between $A$ and $p$.

### Notes

We generate $A$, $B$ and $\lambda$ and $n$. This allows us to derive $d$.

## Type 2

### Question

The $p$ contains the point $A (a_x, a_y, a_z)$ and is parallel to the vectors $d_{p,1}$ and $d_{p,2}$. The line $l$ has equation ${\frac{x-b_x}{d_x} = \frac{y-b_y}{d_y} =  \frac{z-b_z}{d_z}}$. Find

- (a) the coordinates of the point of intersection of $l$ and $p$.
- (b) the acute angle between $l$ and $p$.
- (c\) the perpendicular distance between $A$ and $l$.

### Notes

We generate the point on $l$ ($B$), $\mathbf{d}$ and $\lambda$ first. While $\mathbf{n}$ is also generated, we will obtain $\mathbf{d_{p,1}}$ and $\mathbf{d_{p,2}}$ for encoding and recreate $\mathbf{n}$. 

The point $A$ will always be obtained by ${\mathbf{b} + \lambda \mathrm{d} + \mathrm{d_{p,1}}}$ and $d$ can be obtained from $\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{n}$.
