## Notes

Currently `math-edu` and `math-edu-plus` is used to typeset our expressions: the integration logic is done by hand and implemented as `if-else` statements.

We eventually hope to build a calculus engine to perform such calculations within the library itself.

Also, `Math Atlas` has implemented a more robust question set with many more question types. We have just implemented the two sub-types as a proof or concept relating to the 2007 national examination.

# Implemented Questions

## Type 1a: 2007 P1 Q4

### Question

$$
\displaystyle k \frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}x} = a - by
$$

- (a) Find $y$ in terms of $x$, given that $y=y_0$ when $x = 0$.
- (b) State what happens to $y$ for large values of $x$.

### Answer

- (a) $\displaystyle y = \frac{a}{b} - \frac{A}{b} \mathrm{e}^{-\frac{b}{k}x}$, where $y_0 = \frac{a-A}{b}$.
- (b) $y \to \frac{a}{b}$.

### Notes

Implemented as `type 1a` (note: in the original `Math Atlas 1001`, this was part of "type 2") .

`qnCode` for actual question: `1a234D`.

## Type 1b

### Question

$$
\displaystyle \frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}x} = a \mathrm{e}^{-by}
$$

- (a) Find $x$ in terms of $y$, given that $x=x_0$ when $y = 0$.
- (b) State what happens to $x$ for large, positive values of $y$.

### Answer

- (a) $\displaystyle x = \frac{c}{ab} - \frac{1}{ab} \mathrm{e}^{-by}$, where $x_0 = \frac{c-1}{ab}$.
- (b) $x \to \frac{c}{ab}$.

### Notes

Implemented as `type 1b` (note: in the original `Math Atlas 1001`, this was part of "type 2") .
